Using a variety of soil survey data soil types were assigned a hydrological conductivity and porosity coefficient using standard values and values assignment by the ministry of agriculture and Agri foods. After this depth to bedrock was estimated throughout the study areas using a PDEM along with depth to bedrock data available through the Canadian Water Quality Network database. This was completed using data interpolation techniques and was one area that created uncertainty in this project. Finally, after appropriately preparing all these datasets for use, the Darcy flow tool was used in order to estimate ground water subsurface flow rates at saturation throughout all the headwater watersheds that have been delineated. As the output of the Darcy Flow tool is a raster data set where each cell represents the estimates subsurface flow rate in m/s, the average cell value for each watershed was calculated and displayed to give a better visual representation of the flow rate for each watershed.</p>" +

                "<p>The working watersheds project is meant to help bridge gaps in watershed knowledge in the context of understanding the risks associated with disturbing or losing the integrity of watersheds throughout Ontario. This project aims to give the public an easy-to-use tool that can tell them where a wetland or water body sits within a watershed and what benefits different wetlands and waterbodies may have based on this. Many of the headwater and discharge watersheds throughout the Land Between bioregion. Headwaters play a major role in ground water recharge to wetlands and pave the way for larger river and lake ecosystems and lower elevations by delivering a consistent source of ground water and surface flow. Wetlands play an important role in water security in the context of head waters as they regulate the water delivery from head waters, protect from flood control and help to maintain water quality. That’s why we have identified all the wetlands that intersect with head water watersheds to give the public a better of the wetlands that may be most important for their communities but may be overlooked in provincial or municipal legislation. The same has been done with discharge watersheds to understand what wetlands may be most critical for flood mitigation and water attenuation further along the water cycle.</p>";
