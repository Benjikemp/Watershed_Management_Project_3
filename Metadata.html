    <h1>Layers Produced:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Headwater/recharge watersheds layer</li>
        <li>Headwater/recharge watersheds pour point layer</li>
        <li>Discharge watersheds Layer</li>
        <li>Discharge watersheds pour point Layer</li>
        <li>Wetland classification layer</li>
        <li>Darcy flow layer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sources Used:</h2>

    <h3>Headwater/recharge pour point layer</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>MNR Hydro Network</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Headwater/recharge watershed layer</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Headwater/recharge pour point layer.</li>
        <li>MNR Provincial Digital Elevation Model</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Discharge watersheds Layer/Pour Point Layer</h3>
    <p>As the exact definition of a discharge watershed is slightly vague, watershed that connect smaller stream systems to larger ones and pass directly through a town/city were identified and delineated...</p>

    <h3>Darcy Flow Layer:</h3>
    <p>The Darcy flow layers were created using a variety of layers as indicated above. Using a variety of soil survey data soil types were assigned a hydrological conductivity and porosity coefficient using standard values and values assignment by the ministry of agriculture and Agri foods...</p>

    <h2>Methods:</h2>

    <h3>Headwater/recharge pour point layer.</h3>
    <p>This layer was produced using the Ministry of natural resources (MNR) Hydro Network layer that indicates stream flow and order throughout the province of Ontario...</p>

    <h3>Headwater/recharge watershed layer</h3>
    <p>This layer was produced using the MNR provincial digital elevation model (PDEM) and the previously produced pour point layer. Using the PDEM and ArcGIS Pro a flow direction raster was produced. This layer along with the pour point layer were used as the...</p>

    <h3>Discharge watersheds Layer/Pour Point Layer</h3>
    <p>As the exact definition of a discharge watershed is slightly vague, watershed that connect smaller stream systems to larger ones and pass directly through a town/city were identified and delineated. This was all completed using the Ontario Watershed...</p>

    <h3>Darcy Flow Layer:</h3>
    <p>The Darcy flow layers were created using a variety of layers as indicated above. Using a variety of soil survey data soil types were assigned a hydrological conductivity and porosity coefficient using standard values and values assignment by the...</p>

    <h2>Intro:</h2>

    <p>The working watersheds project is meant to help bridge gaps in watershed knowledge in the context of understanding the risks associated with disturbing or losing the integrity of watersheds throughout Ontario. This project aims to give the public an...</p>
